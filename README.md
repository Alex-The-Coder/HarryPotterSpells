## What is HarryPotterSpells?

As the name sugests, this plugin adds spells and more to a Minecraft server! The spells are taken from Harry Potter but this doesnt mean you have to be a Harry Potter server to use it! Almost everything in this plugin is configurable, allowing you to make your own Spells plugin!
