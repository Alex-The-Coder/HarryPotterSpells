# HarryPotterSpells

## What is HarryPotterSpells?

As the name suggests, this plugin adds spells and more to a Minecraft server! The spells are taken from Harry Potter but this doesn't mean you have to be a Harry Potter server to use it! Almost everything in this plugin is configurable, allowing you to make your own Spells plugin!

For more information check out our [Bukkit Dev page](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/harrypotterspells)!
